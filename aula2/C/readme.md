## C - Fun with Sequences (Act 5) SPOJ - SMPSEQ7 ##

You are given S - a sequence of n integers S = s1, s2, ..., sn. Please, compute if it is possible to split S into two parts: s1, s2, ..., si and si+1, si+2, ..., sn (1 <= i < n) in such a way that the first part is strictly decreasing while the second is strictly increasing one.

## Input data specification ##

    In the first line you are given an integer 2<=n<=100 and in the following line n integers -100 <= si <= 100.



## Output data specification ##

    One word Yes or No.



## Example 1 ##

    Input:
    5 
    -1 2 -1 1 -1 

    Output:
    No



## Example 2 ##

    Input:
    6 
    3 1 -2 -2 -1 3 

    Output:
    Yes



## Example 3 ##

    Input:
    6 
    2 2 1 0 1 2
    
    Output:
    No

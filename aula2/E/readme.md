PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
Charvee likes Mathematics. She wants to calculate a to the power b. Since the value may be very large so she is ok if she gets answer modulo 1e9+7. Help her calculate (a to the power b)%(1e9+7).



## Input ##

    The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
    Next T lines contains the two numbers a and b.



## Output ##

    Output the value in a new line.



## Constraints ##

    1<=T<=100
    1<=a,b<=10^9



## Example ##

    Input:

    2
    2 3
    153536881 89094721

    Output:

    8
    603732084

    Explanation
    Input-1 (2 to the power 3)%1000000007 = 8.
    Input-2 (153536881 to the power 89094721)%1000000007 = 603732084.
